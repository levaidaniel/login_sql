.Sh NAME
.Nm login_sql_pw
.Nd Generates various salted message digests
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl a Ar algorithm
.Op Fl l
.Op Fl p Ar password
.Op Fl h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility complements the login_sql(8) BSD authentication style, and is used to create various salted message digests.
.Nm
actually wraps around
.Xr openssl 1
and generates OpenSSL supported message digests with 4 bytes long salts. You can check what kind of message digests you can use with your OpenSSL version with
.Dl openssl dgst -h
.Ss PARAMETERS
.Bl -tag -offset ||| -width |
.It Fl a Ar algorithm
Use
.Ar algorithm
as the message digest algorithm. You can use any digest that your OpenSSL supports.
See the
.Em EXAMPLES
section.
.It Fl p Ar password
Use
.Ar password
as password. Otherwise
.Nm
will prompt for one.
.It Fl h
This help.
