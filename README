This program can be used to authenticate against PostreSQL using the BSD
authentication framework.

After installation the auth style name will be -pgsql. You can use it after you
configured a login class in login.conf(5) to use this auth style, and created a
config file for the authentication program.

Example config file:

dbname=bsd_login
dbuser=bsd_login
dbpass=bsd_login
table=bsd_login
user_col=username
pass_col=password
digest_alg=sha1


Explanation:
dbname:		The database name
dbuser:		The username used to authenticate to the database
dbpass:		The password used to authenticate to the database
table:		The table name in the database which contains the username and password columns
user_col:	The column's name which contains the username
pass_col:	The column's name which contains the password
digest_alg:	The message digest algorithm which is used to store the password in the database.
		You can use any digest which is supported by your OpenSSL library.


Example login.conf(5):

pgsql:\
	:auth=-pgsql,passwd:\
	:x-pgsql-cfg_file=/etc/auth/pgsql.conf:\
	:tc=default:


The config file parameter is optional. If you omit it, the default will be used, which is /etc/login_pgsql.conf.
